# Cursor AI Assistant Rules for Gaado Backend Project

## Communication Style
- Be brief. Don't explain code unless asked.
- Write only changed code, not the entire file.
- Answer directly without creating files unless required.

## File Management
- DO NOT create multiple README files - only use existing README.md
- DO NOT create separate requirements files (requirements-workers.txt, requirements-local.txt, etc.)
- DO NOT create deployment scripts unless explicitly requested
- DO NOT create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Don't generate unnecessary text files unless asked
- Keep it simple: one requirements.txt, one README.md

## Code Changes
- Only make changes when explicitly requested
- Don't create new methods unless asked, edit existing ones instead
- Don't create "helper" files or "utility" scripts unless asked
- Don't add comments explaining obvious things
- Don't create separate config files for different environments unless necessary
- Try not to write large files, split functionality into components, but don't let them grow into too many small files

## Deployment
- Use `npx wrangler deploy` directly - no wrapper scripts needed
- Cloudflare Workers automatically uses requirements.txt
- Don't create deploy.sh or similar scripts unless explicitly requested

## Project Structure
- Keep existing structure
- Don't reorganize unless asked
- Don't create new directories unless necessary

## When User Asks About Setup
- Explain briefly, don't create files
- Reference existing documentation if it exists
- Only create files if explicitly requested
